# WNS-Analytics-Hackathon-Employee-promotion-predictions
## Introduction to the challenge
<P>   In this competition our client is WNS Analytics, a large MNC company. They want us to identify the right person for a promotion. Currently, this process consists of several steps:</p>

<p> 1. They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations and past performance.</p>
<p> 2. Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical.</p>
<p>3 .At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., an employee gets a promotion.</p>

## The pipeline of promotions

<p> The whole process takes a lot of time. One way to speed it up, so a company would save time and money, is to determine the right candidate at the checkpoint. We will use a data-driven approach to predict if the candidate would be promoted or not. Our prediction will be based on employeeâ€™s performance from nomination for promotion to the checkpoint and number of demographic features.</p>

<p>I filled missing values in education with Bachelor's and previous_year_rating with a 5. All other features have no missing values and outliers, this dataset was comfortable to work with.
